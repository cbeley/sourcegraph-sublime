DISCLAMER: This is just a quick and dirty fix for my person, very specific needs, since the official plugin has been broken for a while.

This may or may not be helpful to you. Maybe I'll put more than a few minutes into it one day...

-   Open the console with <kbd>Ctrl+`</kbd>
-   Make changes to the Python code and watch as Sublime reloads.
-   To release a new version, you MUST update the following files:
    1. `messages.json` (add a new version entry)
    2. `README.md` (describe ALL changes)
    3. `messages/welcome.txt` (copy from README.md change above)
    4. `sourcegraph.py` (`VERSION` constant)
    -   Then `git commit -m "all: release v<THE VERSION>"` and `git push` and `git tag v<THE VERSION>` and `git push --tags`.
    -   Note: it sometimes takes a few hours for it to show up on https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sourcegraph
